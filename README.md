# ECE-391-Linux-Kernel-Class-Project
The ECE 391 Machine Problem 3, in which me and my team built our own Linux Kernel. 
1. Integrated Multi-Terminal Functionality which allows processes to run concurrently on different screens.
2. Implemented System Calls that allow the execution of user-level programs and the opening, closing,
reading and writing of files.
3. Utilized the Real Time Clock and Programmable Interval Timer to generate timed interrupts to be used in scheduling processes and in user-level programs
4. Enabled Kernel to handle Keyboard interrupts to allow Keyboard input to programs
